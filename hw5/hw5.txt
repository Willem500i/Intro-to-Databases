Question 1: Super Keys and Candidate Keys

Super keys: {city_name, state} and {city_name, state, mayor}
- {city_name} alone is not a super key because two cities in different states can have the same name
- {state} alone is not a super key because multiple cities exist in the same state
- {city_name, state} is a super key because cities in the same state must have different names

Candidate key: {city_name, state}
- This is the only candidate key because it is minimal (removing either attribute makes it not a super key)

Question 2: Updates for NY Governor Change

Answer: 1000 rows
Since the governor is stored in every row for NY cities, all 1000 rows would need to be updated when NY gets a new governor.

Question 3: Trivial Functional Dependency

Answer: {city_name, state} → {city_name}
This is trivial because city_name appears on both sides of the dependency.

Question 4: Non-Trivial FD with Superkey on Left

Answer: {city_name, state} → {governor}
This is non-trivial and {city_name, state} is a superkey (the candidate key).

Question 5: Non-Trivial FD with Non-Superkey on Left

Answer: {state} → {governor}
This is non-trivial because each state has exactly one governor, but {state} is not a superkey because multiple cities can be in the same state.

Question 6: Decompose into BCNF

R1: City(city_name, state, mayor)
R2: State(state, governor)

The problematic FD {state} → {governor} violated BCNF in the original schema. By separating governor into its own relation with state as the key, both relations are now in BCNF.

Question 7: Updates After BCNF Normalization

Answer: 1 row
In the BCNF schema, governor is stored only once in the State relation. When NY gets a new governor, only the single row for NY in State(state, governor) needs to be updated.
