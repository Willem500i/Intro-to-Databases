Public Features (2/2):
✅ 1. View Public Info / Search Flights - Users can search for future flights by source city/airport, destination city/airport, and departure date

Airline Staff Features (0/7):

7. Yes, all tables have been added to the database.

Tables Created:
1. Airport - Stores airport information (code, city, country, type)
2. Airline - Stores airline names
3. Airplane - Stores airplane information (weak entity, depends on Airline)
4. Flight - Stores flight information (weak entity, depends on Airline)
5. Customer - Stores customer account information
6. AirlineStaff - Stores airline staff account information
7. Phone - Stores multiple phone numbers for staff (weak entity)
8. Ticket - Stores ticket purchases with payment information
9. Review - Stores customer ratings and comments for flights

Schema Corrections Made:
- Removed duplicate `airplane_airline` column from Flight table (uses `airline_name` directly)
- Removed `review_date` column from Review table

Additional Features Planned:
- Round-trip flight booking (currently UI supports it but backend needs implementation)
- Enhanced filtering and search capabilities
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Input validation improvements

8. Data has been entered into all the tables
